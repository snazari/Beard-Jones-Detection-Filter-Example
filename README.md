# Beard-Jones-Detection-Filter-Example
A Simulink implementation of the BJDF using the White &amp; Speyer approach
Detection filters are used to isolate anomalies by projecting the residual into a subspace spanned by the anomaly. In order to accomplish this, the residual must be designed to have special properties. This submission is a Simulink implementation of the BJDF where the residual generator was designed using the approach of White & Speyer 1985, 1987.
